OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This tool generates SOSA numbering in for your Gedcom. \
    See Sosa numbering convention for details.\n\n\
    At each opening of the gedcom file, entities will be automaticaly scanned and computed \
    by this module, but your gedcom file will not be modified at all. Once you want \
    to generate the Sosa numbering against an individual, just run this plugin from \
    the Tools Menu. Those Sosa numbers won't be written in your gedcom file, but will \
    be kept in memory to see them wherever you want in the different views.\n\n\ \
    If you choose, you can also add a d'Aboville numbering from sosa ascendants.\n\n\ \
    What can it be used for?\n\t\ \
    Many genealogists refer to the individuals in their tree by their sosa number as it is more meaningful than random ids. \
    By adding a column in the edit view of Ancestris, these numbers can be displayed for quick reference.
