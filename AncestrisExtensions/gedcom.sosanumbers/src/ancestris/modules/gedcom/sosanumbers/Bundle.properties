    <h1><center>SOSA numbering</center></h1>\n\n<p>This tool generates SOSA numbering in for your Gedcom.\
    </p>\n\n<p>To access it, Main Menu, Tools, Gedcom, SOSA numbering.\
    <p>See Sosa numbering convention for details.</p>\n\n\
    <p>At each opening of the gedcom file, entities will be automaticaly scanned and computed \
    by this module, but your gedcom file will not be modified at all. Once you want \
    to generate the Sosa numbering against an individual, just run this plugin from \
    the Tools Menu. Those Sosa numbers won't be written in your gedcom file, but will \
    be kept in memory to see them wherever you want in the different views.</p>\n\n\ \
    <p>If you choose, you can also add a d'Aboville numbering from sosa ascendants.</p>\n\n\ \
    <p>What can it be used for?</p>\n\t\ \
    <p>Many genealogists refer to the individuals in their tree by their sosa number as it is more meaningful than random ids. \
    By adding a column in the edit view of Ancestris, these numbers can be displayed for quick reference.\
    </p>\n\n<p>To access it, Main Menu, Tools, Gedcom, SOSA numbering.\
