ImportVisualWarning.warning=Please read.\n\nThis tool is here to import your data to Ancestris and to fix all errors it can encounter.\n\nIn fact, all genealogy program doesn't give a file 100% compliant with the gedcom specifications.\nIf this tool can't fix most of the errors, it will give up. So you will have to simply open your gedcom file from the main menu, with File-->Open and give the path and name of your genealogy file to be able to load it and work on it.\nEven if this tool accept your data, it won't be able to fix everything, so it's possible that you will have to open it with a text editor to work a little bit on it.\n\nAs we want to improve this tool, if it failed to import your gedcom, please send your file to support@ancestris.org and we will do our best to make it work.
