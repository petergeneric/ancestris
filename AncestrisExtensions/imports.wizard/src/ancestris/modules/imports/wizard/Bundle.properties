ImportVisualWarning.warning=<html><b>Please read.</b><br/>This tool is intended to import your data to Ancestris and to try to fix all errors it can encounter.<br/><br/>In fact, all genealogy programs don't produce a file 100% compliant with the gedcom specifications.<br/>If this tool can't fix most of the errors, it will give up. So you will have to simply open your gedcom file from the main menu, with File-->Open and give the path and name of your genealogy file to be able to load it and work on it.<br/><br/>Even if this tool accept your data, it won't be able to fix everything, so it's possible that you will have to open it with a text editor to work a little bit on it.<br/><br/>As we want to improve this tool, if it failed to import your gedcom, please send your file to "support@ancestris.org" and we will do our best to make it work.<br /><br /></html>
