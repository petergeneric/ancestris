OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=This plugin gives you a list of the different family groups that make up your genealogy. You can see groups of people who are not yet related together. The advantage of managing the family groups is that during your work, you will see links between groups, and that way, connect one group to another group and thus have a continuity in the numbering of individuals and families in your family tree.\nOnce installed, that plugin will be available thru Ancestris Main menu - Tools - Family groups.
