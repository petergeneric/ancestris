    errors it will find.</p>\n<p>If this plugin can't fix most of the problems, or if \
    your gedcom file comes from another genealogy program not yet supported, feel free \
    to ask our dev. Team to develop a new plugin specific to your former program.</p>\n<p> \
    Post a request to "support@ancestris.org" and join to your mail your gedcom file. \
    But be aware that we can develop something only if your previous program is a \
    known program which is used by many people.<br /> \<br /> \
