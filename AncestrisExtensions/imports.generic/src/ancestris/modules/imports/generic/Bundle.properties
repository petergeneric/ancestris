    <h1><center>Generic import</center></h1>\n\n<p>This tool imports a gedcom file coming from a software not covered by the other import extensions. \
    It will try to fix all errors found. If this plugin cannot fix most of the problems, or if \
    your gedcom file comes from a genealogy program not yet supported, feel free \
    to ask our development Team to develop a new plugin specific to your former program. For that, post a request to "support@ancestris.org" attaching your gedcom file. \
    </p>\n\n<p>Be aware that we will only be able to fullfill your request if your genealogy program to convert from, is a known software. \
