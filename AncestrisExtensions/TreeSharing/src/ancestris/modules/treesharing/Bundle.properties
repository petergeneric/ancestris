OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This module lets you share genealogy trees with other Ancestris users with all necessary confidentiality. \n\
    If you decide to do so, Ancestris will identify among other Ancestris users which ones have common information with you. \
    Ancestris will then allow you to contact these other users and potentially share useful information.
