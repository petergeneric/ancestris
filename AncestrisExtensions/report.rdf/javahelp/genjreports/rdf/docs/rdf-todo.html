        <h3 class="ancestris_help_title">6 - To do</h3>
        <p class="justify">
            This plugin is delivered as a proof of concept. 
            Though it is a report framework on its own, it is squeezed into 
            the user interface of the existing report framework.
            Some suggestions for further development.
        </p>

        <h4 class="ancestris_help_title">a) Dedicated user interface</h4>
        <p class="justify">
            This plug-in would become easier to operate with a dedicated user
            interface.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
            The query options group should be
            replaced with edit boxes that allow to read and save plain
            text files. A single drop
            downlist can load a pair of built-in files in the edit-boxes.
            This list replaces the above overview of examples.
            The optional prefixes of the filenames indicate the required 
            context (FAM/INDI) and rules (q/s for quick/slow).
            A file chooser per box can load and save custom queries and rules.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
            The output options group
            should use file choosers and these choosers should filter on the
            suggested extensions.
        </p>

        <h4 class="ancestris_help_title">b) Get more from the semantic web</h4>
        <p class="justify">
            The semantic web uses triples of URI's: subject predicate object.
            An ontology (also expressed in triples) explains and defines types and meanings.
            An ontology also implies inference. The mother of all ontologies is OWL. 
            At the moment applying full-fledged inference is slow. Common practice
            is to apply just the rules you actually need.
            This is a very brief introduction but it should have the most important
            pointers to start browsing the web about the subject.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
            The conversion does not comply to an established ontology.
            Cross site queries and inference would be easier when using
            something like FOAF or a similar ontology. 
            The chosen format however was quick and easy to implement
            and is easy to recognise by GedCom tigers. Flexibility of the 
            semantic web can deal which such an unorthodox approach.
            It might be wise to monitor for ontologies that might emerge and could
            replace the quick-and-dirty approach.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
            <i>The power of the semantic web could become available when 
            the plugin would allow to read more semantic data than just the
            converted GedCom.</i>
            For example allow users to selectively download and collect whatever they want
            into a directory and read those files. A wizard could help with the selection.<br/> 
            DbPedia could be an interesting almanac, 
            for example to find famous contemporary local peaople,
            an example of available data:
            <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
                <param name="content" value="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin/">
                <param name="text" value="<html><u>http://dbpedia.org/data/Berlin.n3</u></html>">
                <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
                <param name="textColor" value="blue">
            </object><br/>
            Geonames is interesting for maps, see Amsterdam as an example
            <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
                <param name="content" value="http://www.geonames.org/2759794/amsterdam.html">
                <param name="text" value="<html><u>http://sws.geonames.org/2759794/about.rdf</u></html>">
                <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
                <param name="textColor" value="blue">
            </object>
        </p>

        <h4 class="ancestris_help_title">c) Disconnect conversion and reporting</h4>
        <p class="justify">
            If low priority background process are possible
            it might be an idea to perform conversion after saving the gedcom file.
            Performance of interactive functions should not suffer
            from such a background process.
            Escpecially because the slow rules may take minutes.
            Report generation should check if the last changes are saved
            and the conversion is completed.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
            It should also be possible to keep the rdf model synchronised.
            That would mean deleting all the tripples related to 
            the changed entity or property and insert them all again.
        </p>

Tip: to create a link which will open in an external web browser, try on the end of a line/paragraph:

To create a link to a help set from another module, you need to know the code name base and path, e.g.:

(This link will behave sanely if that module is disabled or missing.)
