        <h3 class="ancestris_help_title">6 - To do</h3>
        <p class="justify">
            This plugin is delivered as a proof of concept. 
            Though it is a report framework on its own, it is squeezed into 
            the user interface of the existing report framework.
            Some suggestions for further development.
        </p>

        <h4 class="ancestris_help_title">a) Dedicated user interface</h4>
        <p class="justify">
            This plug-in would become easier to operate with a dedicated user
            interface.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
            The query options group should be
            replaced with edit boxes that allow to read and save plain
            text files. A single drop
            down list can load a pair of built-in files in the edit-boxes.
            This list replaces the above overview of examples.
            The optional prefixes of the filenames indicate the required 
            context (FAM/INDI) and rules (q/s for quick/slow).
            A file chooser per box can load and save custom queries and rules.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
            The output options group
            should use file choosers and these choosers should filter on the
            suggested extensions.
        </p>

        <h4 class="ancestris_help_title">b) Get more from the semantic web</h4>
        <p class="justify">
             A wizard could help to collect external data as described in the mashup section.
             The tools described there allow to disconnect conversion and reporting.
             Less stechnical users however may have problems using them.
        </p>

        <h4 class="ancestris_help_title">c) Disconnect conversion and reporting</h4>
        <p class="justify">
            If low priority background process are possible
            it might be an idea to perform conversion after saving the GedCom file.
            Performance of interactive functions should not suffer
            from such a background process.
            Especially because the slow rules may take minutes.
            Report generation should check if the last changes are saved
            and the conversion is completed.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
            It should also be possible to keep the rdf model synchronised.
            That would mean deleting all the triples related to 
            the changed entity or property and insert them all again.
        </p>

        <h4 class="ancestris_help_title">d) Cancel query execution</h4>
        <p class="justify">
            A mistake in a query might cause to execute forever.
            It should be executed in a subprocess that can be killed when the users chooses so.
        </p>

        <h3 class="ancestris_help_title">7 - Known bugs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You might have to run a context-free query before you can run
            a query that should be launched for an entity.
          </li>

Tip: to create a link which will open in an external web browser, try on the end of a line/paragraph:
<object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
    <param name="content" value="http://www.netbeans.org/">
    <param name="text" value="<html><u>http://www.netbeans.org/</u></html>">
    <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
    <param name="textColor" value="blue">
</object>
To create a link to a help set from another module, you need to know the code name base and path, e.g.:
<a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/configure/configure_options.html">Using the Options Window</a>
(This link will behave sanely if that module is disabled or missing.)
