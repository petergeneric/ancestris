<a name = "1"><p>
  <b><a Href="#index"><Font color="red">Q</Font></a></b> What is GenJ all about?<br>
  <b>A</b> GenealogyJ (in short GenJ) is a viewer and editor for genealogical data stored in Gedcom format.
</p>

<a name = "2"><p>
  <b><a Href="#index"><Font color="red">Q</Font></a></b> Is there a discussion forum devoted to GenJ ?<br>
  <b>A</b> Yes, in the 
    <a href="http://genj.sourceforge.net/forum">GenJ Forum</a>
<p>

<a name = "3"><p>
 <b><a Href="#index"><Font color="red">Q</Font></a></b> What does Gedcom stand for?<br>
 <b>A</b><a href="./../concepts/gedcom.html">This</A> document has more information about Gedcom.
</p>

<a name = "4"><p>
 <b><a Href="#index"><Font color="red">Q</Font></a></b> How do I get pictures to show up in Tree View?<br>
 <b>A</b> 
 To show a picture for every person in the main Tree view add
 a multimedia property (OBJE) to your individuals. Simply bring
 up an indivdual in <a href="../view/edit.html">Edit View</a>, choose the topmost
 property INDI, click on '+' and choose OBJE to be added.
 Point the sub-property FILE to a file in your computer's 
 file-system (button '>>') and the images will be picked up by 
 <a href="../view/tree.html">Tree View</a> (it's looking
 for INDI:OBJE:FILE automatically).
</p>

<a name = "5"><p>
 <b><a Href="#index"><Font color="red">Q</Font></a></b> Can I change the language that GenJ speaks?<br>
 <b>A</b> 
  You can download an appropriate language pack (genj_ll-x.y.zip) for GenJ
  (e.g. genj_fr-2.0.zip) from the 
    <a target=project href="http://genj.sourceforge.net">project's homepage</a>
  GenJ will try to use the language of your operating system automatically. 
  To explicitly switch to a language (the language pack has to been installed 
  manually) 
  choose menu-item <em>Help|About</em> and flip to the <em>Look&Feel</em>-Tab.
  Then select the language of choice.
</p>

<a name = "6"><p>
 <b><a Href="#index"><Font color="red">Q</Font></a></Font></a></b> Can I make a centimeter look like one on my screen?<br>
 <b>A</b> GenJ uses real-world metrics for various components (e.g. in
  <a href="../view/tree.html">Tree View</a>). To make lengths of lines and
  sizes of boxes appear correctly on your screen you'll have to tell GenJ
  about your display's resolution (which is reported by the operating system
  but normally doesn't match system's monitor). 
  To explicitly adjust the resolution 
  choose menu-item <em>Help|About</em> and flip to the <em>Look&Feel</em>-Tab. 
  Then use a ruler to match the shown rulers on your screen.
</p>

<a name = "7"><p>
 <b><a Href="#index"><Font color="red">Q</Font></a></b> Can I change the look of GenJ?<br>
 <b>A</b> GenJ uses the Swing Toolkit for presenting information to the
 user. This is system dependant by default. GenJ allows to change the current 
 Look&Feel as well. 
 You can download the Look&Feel pack (genj_lnf-x.y.zip) from the
    <a target=project href="http://genj.sourceforge.net">project's homepage</a>. 
  After restarting GenJ you can change the Look&Feel in GenJ's list of Options.

<a name = "8"><p>
 <b><a Href="#index"><Font color="red">Q</Font></a></b> I have an existing person and I want to make it a child of 
 another existing person. The only available option I can see is to 
 add a *new* child/parent to an existing record, but there doesn't seem 
 to be an option to add an *existing* person as a child/parent. How do 
 I do this?<br>
 <b>A</b> You can go to the 'existing' parent (or the parental family 
 for the 'existing' child). Then choose "Add Child" from context menu 
 and in the following dialog choose the person of your choice from the 
 drop-down box at the top.<Br>
 This way no new person will be created as a child but a relationship to 
 the 'existing' one is built.
</p>

<a name = "10"><p>
 <b><a Href="#index"><Font color="red">Q</Font></a></b>Why do images get rendered at different size?<br>
 <b>A</b> The blueprints do play a role in the outcome of rendering. 
 Depending on how much has to be shown in a box the space for an image 
 can be limited because it will be shrunk to make space for text. 
 If there's enough space then the image uses as much space as possibly
 to fit it's real dimensions (determined by size *and* resolution).
 That's why they can look different.
</p>

<a name = "11"><p>
 <b><a Href="#index"><Font color="red">Q</Font></a></b>How can I capture information about adoptions?<br>
 <b>A</b> Add an ADOPtion event to an individual in Edit View and then add
 a reference to the Family that adopted the individual (through the context-menu
 of the ADOPtion event).
</p>

<a name="12"><p>
 <b><a Href="#index"><Font color="red">Q</Font></a></b> How can I get in touch with GenJ users or developers? Where can I get further information about GenJ?<br>
<b>A</b>
