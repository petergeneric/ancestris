                 This report is a checklist of how your ancestor tree information is progressed.<br/> \n\
                 The genealogist can see very quickly missing ancestors (empty lines) or missing data (empty characters).<br /> \n\
                 To get a genealogy tree that is basically complete, the goal is therefore to get all lines filled in with "1111" for each event (see flags meaning below). \n\
                 <br /> \n\
                 This report relies on the SOSA or SOSADABOVILLE numbers. They can be generated using the SOSA generation tool in the Tools menu. \n\
                 <br /><br /> \n\

                 <li><b>Chr:</b> Same as above for christening. This event is optional, and does not trigger an anomaly if it is missing.<br /> \n\
                 <li><b>Marr:</b> Same as above for mariage. In addition the symbol "@" is added if children do not follow a chronological order. This event triggers an anomaly if it is missing.<br /> \n\
                 <li><b>Fam:</b> Identification number of the family this individual is a spouse of. A spouse must exist, be different from the individual and have a sosa number. Clic on it to display in the editor.<br /> \n\
