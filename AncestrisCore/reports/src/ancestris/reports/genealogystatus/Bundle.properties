                 This report is a checklist of how your ancestor tree information is progressed.<br/> \
                 The genealogist can see very quickly missing ancestors (empty lines) or missing data (empty characters).<br /> \
                 To get a genealogy tree that is basically complete, the goal is therefore to get all lines filled in with "1111" for each event (see flags meaning below). \
                 <br /> \
                 This report relies on the SOSA or SOSADABOVILLE numbers. They can be generated using the SOSA generation tool in the Tools menu. \
                 <br /><br /> \
                 <b>Examples of usage this report can provide:</b> \
                 <ul> \
                 <li>Track progress of research.<br /> \
                 <li>Check dates and locations for events.<br /> \
                 <li>Check sources.<br /> \
                 <li>Attach sources.<br /> \
                 <li>Resolve sequence of kids.<br /> \
                 <li>Look for media files to attach.<br /> \
                 <li>Check if some entities in your genealogy are not used by any of the others.<br /> \
                 <li>Check if some media files located on your disk are not used by your genealogy.<br /> \
                 </ul> \
                 <b>Options:</b> \
                 <ul> \
                 <li><b>Max nb of missing ancestors to display:</b>  \
                 Number of ancestors above which we do not display missing ancestors.<br /> \
                 <li><b>Display siblings:</b>  \
                 Displays siblings for each ancestor found, in addition to the ancestor itself.<br /> \
                 <li><b>Media directory :</b>  \
                 Displays siblings for each ancestor found, in addition to the ancestor itself.<br /> \

                 <b>Columns meaning:</b> \

                 <li><b>Sosa:</b> Sosa number of individual<br /> \
                 <li><b>Gen:</b> Number of Genealogy level for the individual<br /> \
                 <li><b>Id:</b> Identification number of the individual. Clic on it to display in the editor.<br /> \
                 <li><b>Med:</b> Existence of a media for the individual : first number is the number of media found, code '1' indicates all media have valid files for each, '\u00a7' otherwise.<br /> \
                 <li><b>Birt:</b> 4 digits indicating Date of birth (' ', '.', '1', else '#'), Place of birth (' ', '.', '1', else '#'), number of sources of birth found (' ', 'n' else '#'), valid file exist for all sources of birth and text is not empty ('1', else '\u00a7').<br /> \
                 <li><b>Chr:</b> Same as above for christening. This event is optional, and does not trigger an anomaly if it is missing.<br /> \
                 <li><b>Marr:</b> Same as above for mariage. In addition the symbol "@" is added if children do not follow a chronological order. This event triggers an anomaly if it is missing.<br /> \
                 <li><b>Fam:</b> Identification number of the family this individual is a spouse of. A spouse must exist, be different from the individual and have a sosa number. Clic on it to display in the editor.<br /> \
                 <li><b>Occu:</b> Same as christening for the occupation. This event is optional.<br /> \
                 <li><b>Death:</b> Same as birth and marriage, for death event.<br /> \

                 <li><b>"~":</b> Event exist, is correctly documented and valid, but incomplete. A date is a range, place city is missing.<br /> \

                 <li><b>"#":</b> Event exists and is documented but is invalid or just incomplete. A date could be just an approximative range. A place could have the wrong number of jurisdictions (see column meaning and list of general anomalies below).<br /> \
                 <li><b>"@":</b> Kids in a familly do not appear chronologically.<br /> \
                 <li><b>"\u00a7":</b> Text of source is missing or empty, or media file or source file is missing or invalid.<br /> \
