name     = Lineage of ancestry by generation

info     = <h1><center>Lineage of ancestry by generation</center></h1> \
  <h1><center>(Sosa classification)</center></h1> \
  <br> \
  <p>This reports displays a list of ancestors in four ways: \
  <ul> \
  <li>Sosa generations \
  <li>Sosa generations in table form \
  <li>Ancestor lineage \
  <li>Agnatic lineage only (father's name) \
  </ul> \
  </p> \
  To start the report you must first choose the root individual. \
  This can be done from the context menu of an Individual,  \
  or by selecting the individual after running the report.  \
  Each individual will be given a Sosa number,  \
  starting with the root individual as 1. \
  <h2>Options:</h2> \
  <ul> \
  <li><b>Report Structure</b> - choose between the four ways of displaying the ancestors \
  of the root individual. \
  <li><b>Presentation of Events</b> - choose "One event per line" for a  \
  list of events for each person, or "One Individual per Line" to have events listed \
  in paragraph form. \
  </ul> \
  Between these two options you can generate several different looking reports. \
  <h2>Additional Options:</h2> \
  <ul> \
  <li><b>Display bullets</b> - if "One event per line" is chosen, each event will \
  be bulleted. \
  <li><b>Starting Sosa Number</b> - any starting number can be chosen for root individual \
  <li><b>Tag used in GEDCOM</b> - the tag used when storing Sosa numbers \
  within the GEDCOM file. \
  <li><b>Generations considered private</b> - number of generations that will \
  not be shown in the output, the names and events will be shown as "...". \
  This report also uses the global 'x' number of years are hidden. \
  <li><b>First Generation to display</b> - begins Sosa report from given generation number \
  <li><b>Max number of generations</b> - stops enumerating ancestors if this number is reached \
  <li><b>Show Birthplace, Birthdate, etc</b> - show the various events within the report  \
  <li><b>Show all Jurisdictions</b> - chosen shows every location for an event, rather \
  than the first location encountered for that event \
  <li><b>Choose how to display sources</b> - various options on displaying sources \
  <li><b>Display sources when none found</b> - shows a "no source" when none is found \
  (useful to indicate an event exists but no source corresponds to it) \
  <li><b>Also use event prefix for sources</b> - places event prefix in front of source \
  <li><b>Word used in front of sources</b> - prefix or word in front of source \
  <li><b>Color of sources</b> - list of colors available to make sources stand out \
  </ul> \
  <h2>Output Examples:</h2> \
  <ul> \

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 grandfather 2 \
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 grandmother 2 \

  <h2>Regarding Sources:</h2> \
  <ul> \
  <li>Three levels of text are retrieved from the sources \
  <li>The text from the 'SOUR:TEXT' tag is from the source file \
  <li>The notes from the 'SOUR:NOTE' tag is from the source file \
  <li>The source notes associated with an event, either tag 'INDI:event:SOUR:NOTE', \
  'FAM:event:SOUR:NOTE', 'INDI:event:SOUR:DATA:TEXT', or 'FAM:event:SOUR:DATA:TEXT' \
