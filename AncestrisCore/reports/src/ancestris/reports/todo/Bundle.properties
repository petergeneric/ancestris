info		= <h1><center>To Do List</center></h1> \
 <p>This report shows all to-do's for a gedcom file, \
 e.g. a 'to-do' to scan a document or to check information. \
 </p> \
 <p>Of course, if you want this report to find something \
 you have to prepare your data appropriately. \
 You have many possibilities, but here are some \
 examples :</p> \
 <ul> \
 <li>First, you can create markers inside your \
 tree, as "_TODO" (note that this marker begins with an underscore "_").</li> \
 <li>Secondly you can use internal notes for your \
 tree. For example, if you have created a general NOTE  \
 (i.e. a gedcom <NOTE> tag), with something like "I have to find this  \
 information, I have to check it". Each time you want to specify that \
 for something into your tree, for an information, all \
 you have to do is to create an internal link to that \
 NOTE entity, and the report will follow such links.</li> \
 <li>Last but not least, you can have NOTEs \
 already under certain informations (under a date of \
 birth for example, ...), what you can do, is to add \
 a specific word to that NOTE, that will mean that \
 this NOTE will be checked by the report once run (ex. \
 you begin your NOTE with the word "TODO: "). Each \
 times the report will find that sentence "TODO: " into \
 a NOTE, it will add that note and its contain into the \
 ToDos list.</li> \
 </ul> \
 <p> \
 The options specify where to look for such data. \
 The first to name is in which tag to look for to \
 do's. As such information is usually stored in \
 NOTEs, this tag is pre-defined. The information \
 how to do start, e.g. by "_todo:" is optional and \
 can be used to refine the search. The output maybe \
 created in form of a detailled list or a summary. \
 It is also possible to export the data to CVS. \
