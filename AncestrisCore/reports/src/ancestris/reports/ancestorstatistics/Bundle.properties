name	= Ancestor Statistics

info = <h1><center>Ancestor Statistics</center></h1> \n\
 <p>This report prints the number of ancestors found, coverage factor, implex factor and coefficient of consanguinity.</p> \n\
 <p>The coverage factor is the ratio between the known and all possible ancestors. An  \n\
 implex is a common ancestor, a person who appears several times in the ancestor tree.  \n\
 So the implex factor is the ratio between the number of duplicated ancestors and the  \n\
 number of counted ancestors. No common ancestor gives 0. Example: If an individual  \n\
 has 100 ancestors, but only 80 differents, the implex factor is (100 - 80) / 100 = 20%.</p> \n\
 <p>The coefficient of consanguinity is the probability that the two allele genes that  \n\
 an individual has at a locus are identical by descendants. This assumes that a common  \n\
 ancestor is shared by each parent of the individual.</p> \n\
 <p>This report can only be run from an individual's context-menu.</p>
