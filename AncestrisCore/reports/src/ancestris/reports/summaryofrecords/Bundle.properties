              This report produces a series of summary sheets of individuals or families in the form of a file of which you can choose the format (html, pdf, etc.). \
              <p>It includes individuals and families resulting from the advanced research, otherwise it defaults to the close relatives of the individual selected in Ancestris. </p> \
              <p><h3> <u> Warning </u>: </h3> \
              Depending on the size of your genealogy, creating a pdf or html file can take time, even a long time if you insert images, and \
              you are requesting the creation of an Index of places for each event (death, publication of banns, birth, marriage, etc. ...). </p>
