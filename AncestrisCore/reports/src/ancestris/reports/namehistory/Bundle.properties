name    = Names in History graph

info    = <h1><center>Names in History</center></h1> \
 <p>Shows the history of family names along the timeline of a GEDCOM file.</p> \
 <p>Notes about the report options:</p> \
 <ul><li>too small a percentage makes calculation impossible.</li> \
 <li>even if surname prefixes are ignored, percentages will be calculated over the original name. \
 For example: if "van Veen" and "van der Veen" each have a frequency of 1.5% and the threshold is set to 2%, the name "Veen" won't show up. \
 </li> \
 <li>prefixes are only ignored if spelled in lower case</li> \
 </ul> \
