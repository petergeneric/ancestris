    It will try to fix all errors found. If this plugin cannot fix most of the problems, or if \
    your gedcom file comes from a genealogy program not yet supported, feel free \
    to ask our development Team at "support@ancestris.org" attaching your gedcom file. \

# Specific issues
importlegacy.issue1=We are aware of a translation issue for Legacy and occupation titles might entered instead of names prefixes and suffixes.\n\
                    It seems to be the case for this genealogy. Ancestris can convert these fields into occupations for all individuals.\n\n\
                    Do you want Ancestris to convert these fields ?
