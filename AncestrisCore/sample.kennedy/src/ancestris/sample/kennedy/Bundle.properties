OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This plugin gives you an idea of what a genealogy looks like with Ancestris. Of course, it's very limited, as our purpose is not to establish the genealogy of that family, but we have had in mind to show you how the gedcom tags are organized and to make it in english only. Feel free to improve it and send us your mods.
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=A very limited genealogy for the Kennedy family (in english)
