demo.intro=<html>\
           Welcome to Ancestris Guided Tour !<br><br>\
           We will see the main features of the application using the Bourbon genealogy.<br>\
           </html>

demo.windows=<html>\
           The Ancestris application displays several windows, a main menu and a toolbar.<br><br>\
           1. The left hand side of the screen is generally used to display your genealogy and some analysis,<br>\
           the right hand side is generally used to enter data into your genealogy.<br><br>\
           2. But you can adapt the positions of the windows according to your working needs:<br>\
           - Windows can be moved around if you drag-and-drop their tab handle.<br>\
           - They can also be put away as drawers on the screen borders.<br>\
           </html>

demo.menu=<html>\
           You can access all Ancestris features using the main menu.<br><br>\
           Two topics are used most often : the View menu and the Tools menu.<br><br>\
           - Views let you see your genealogy under various forms.<br><br>\
           - Tools let you analyse your genealogy, clean it, do genealogy searches, add other genealogies to it, publish it, etc.<br><br>\
           The toolbar includes most useful features of the menus.<br>\
           </html>

demo.menuview=<html>\
           The View menu provides ways to see your genealogy as a tree, a list, on a geographical map, on a country timeline depending on selected countries, in reports, etc.<br><br>\
           </html>

demo.menutools=<html>\
           The Tools menu provides many working tools (common ancestors, calculator, date calculator).<br><br>\
           You can search genealogy information, manage your data, or publish your genealogy.<br><br>\
           You can also change your Ancestris settings.<br>\
           </html>

demo.gedcomtools=<html>\
           Accessed from the Tools menu, you can get to the Gedcom tools menu.<br><br>\
           These tools help you generate sosa numbers, clean your genealogy data, merge other genealogies, check duplicates, check anomalies (ex: inconsistent dates, gedcom compliance errors).<br>\
           </html>


demo.properties=<html>\
           The File menu is used to open, close, export genealogies, or make partial copies of it.<br><br>\
           You also have the very useful 'Properties' feature. It is an assistant to help you change your key gedcom file parameters.<br><br>\
           This assistant lets you change for instance the structure of your genealogy physical locations, the location of your media files on disk, or the Gedcom norm to use.<br>\
           </html>

demo.menuhelp=<html>\
           The Help menu provides the Ancestris help content, the version number used, and the Welcome window.<br><br>\
           You can also make a donation to the Ancestris association, or ask questions to the users community.<br><br>\
           Now that we have covered the main menus, let's have a look at the most important Windows.<br><br>\

           Ancestris directly edits the Gedcom file of the genealogies, hence the name "Gedcom Explorer".<br><br>\

           Two other views exist : the 'Place List', and the 'Place Table'. They are used to manage the information about places. For instance, you can define for each location to have its current and ancient names.<br><br>\
