    "Plugins" (or modules) are non standalone programs, that "marry" 
    with Ancestris main program to add more features.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Installed plugins and available plugins</b><br>
    These are found in&nbsp;: "<b>Tools -> Plugins</b>". The number 
    between brackets in the 2nd and 4th tabs indicates then number of 
    plugins.<br>
    For each one, the right area will give you specific information.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Dowloanding and installing</b><br>
    To install one (or several) plugins, you just need a few clicks 
    from the "Available plugins (x)" tab.<br>

  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Click <b>Check for newest</b> to get an updated list.<br>
    To skip this stage&nbsp;: at the Settings tab, lower area, choose 
    "Automatically check for updates -> Check Interval -> Every Startup".  
    </li>
    <li><b>Installation:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>check the box for the plugins you want. "Install" button 
        becomes active;</li>
        <li>click it and the window "Plugin installer" opens, with a 
        summary of the plugins you chose;</li>
        <li>confirm you intentions by clicking "Next". Another window 
        opens with the license agreement for the use of the plugins. 
        To carry on with the installation, you must accept the terms of 
        all licenses associated to the selected plugins;</li>
        <li>check the box, below at the left side, "I accept the terms 
        in all of the license agreements". Button "Install",  becomes 
        active;</li>
        <li>click it. The plugins are downloaded. A window opens, 
        "Validation Warning", to let you know if there is, or not, a 
        signature for the plugins. Don't worry, you won't be taking 
        any risks, these plugins are certainly from the oficial page 
        of Ancestris;</li>
        <li>click "Continue".</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>     
  The installation is over. In some cases, you will have to restart 
  the software before you can use the new plugins.<br>
  <br>
  <p class="justify">
  <b>Uninstall a plugin</b><br>
  Open "Tools -> Plugins" again, this time, tab "Installed (x)".</p>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>check the boxes of the plugins you want to uninstall. Button 
      "Uninstall" becomes active;</li>
      <li>click "Uninstall". The window "Plugin Installer" opens, with 
      a summary of the plugins you want to uninstall;</li>
      <li>Confirm your choice.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  After uninstalling, you will have to restart Ancestris "immediately" 
  (preferable) or "later". Once selected, click "Finish".<br>
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  Don't hesitate in testing the plugins, uninstalling is easy, quick 
  and complete.<br>
  You probably won't even want this.<br>
