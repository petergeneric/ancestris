      <p class="justify">
        In the directory where I have my genealogy main file (usually your_name.ged)
        I have lots of files as mygen_20140922-084346.ged 
        (of course, "mygen" is an example as the digits you find after).<br>
        You have to know that Ancestris will create each time you save your 
        work, a backup file named "aaaaaaaa" (aaaaaaa is the name your 
        genealogy file ; if your file is named johnson, aaaaa will be 
        "johnson") followed by many digits. Those figures represent: the year,
        the month, the day, the hour, minutes and seconds.<br>
        So if you have saved your genealogy on june 14, 2014 at 8:20:54pm, your 
        file will be named:<br>
        johnson_20140614_202054.ged<br>
        <br>
        <u>Question</u>: But why do I have plenty of those files?<br>
        <u>Answer</u>: Ancestris will create a backup file each time you save 
        your work, and it will create as many backup files as you have 
        configurate it in the Ancestris config menu.<br>
        In the config menu, "Main Menu", "Tools", "Preferences", "Files" tab, 
        you have a parameter "Number of backups". If you choose "10", Ancestris 
        will create and keep the last ten backup files. The newer erase the 
        older.<br>
        <br>
        Those backup files have no use for you except if you want to revert 
        to a previous work. If you did a mistake while working on your genealogy, 
        you will be happy to be able to go back in the past and take one of 
        those backup files.<br>
        <i>For example, this morning (june 14th, 2014) you did lots of work in 
        your genealogy, but suddenly, you see you were wrong to enter all 
        those persons. Close and exit Ancestris, go the directory where your 
        .ged file is located, rename your .ged file that way 
        eg. johnson.ged.backup_after_my_mistake, and copy one of your backup 
        files, let's say the one dated yesterday, 
        eg. johnson_20140613_185212.ged to johnson.ged, and voila.<br>
        Fire up Ancestris and you're ready to work again.</i><br>

        What a wonderful world ..... ;-)<br>

Tip: to create a link which will open in an external web browser, try:
<object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
    <param name="content" value="http://www.netbeans.org/">
    <param name="text" value="<html><u>http://www.netbeans.org/</u></html>">
    <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
    <param name="textColor" value="blue">

To create a link to a help set from another module, you need to know the code name base and path, e.g.:
<a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/configure/configure_options.html">Using the Options Window</a>
(This link will behave sanely if that module is disabled or missing.)
