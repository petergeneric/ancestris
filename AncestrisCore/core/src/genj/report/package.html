<body>

Reports are simple, plug-able Java Types which are executed in the context 
of GenealogyJ. They can access the underlying object-representation of 
Gedcom-files opened by the user. 

<p>
A selection of reports comes with the GenealogyJ distribution and can be
found in the report-directory inside the GenJ installation directory.
</p>

<h2>Running Reports</h2>

<p>There are multiple ways of intergrating a report with GenJ. Generally every 
report found in the report-directory (or one of its sub-directories) will be
loaded and displayed in ReportView. There the user can read about the
report's author and operation description, set report-options and run 
them individually. </p>

<p>A report can also be run by opening the context-menu for a Gedcom element
in the UI. Depending on the selected element (for example an entity, a
property or a Gedcom-file itself) reports that can accept this context as
input are presented. The simplest way for a report to declare that it can run 
on a given Gedcom object is by declaring any of these methods:</p>

 <pre> start(genj.gedcom.Gedcom aGedcomInput)
 start(genj.gedcom.Property aPropertyInput)
 start(genj.gedcom.Property[] propertiesInput)
 start(genj.gedcom.Entity[] entitiesInput)
 start(genj.gedcom.Entity anEntityInput) </pre>

<p>If the user selects the right input those reports are automatically matched
for selection to be run.</p>

<p>Another more advanced way to declare applicability to be run is to override:</p>

 <pre> <a href=./Report.html#accepts(java.lang.Object)>String accepts(Object context)</a> </pre>
 
<p>The report is expected to return a text that describes the report's action on given context or
null if the input is not compatible. The report still has to declare one of the start-methods
above or override this basic method (should normally not be necessary):</p>

 <pre> <a href=./Report.html#start(java.lang.Object)>String accepts(Object context)</a> </pre>

<h2>Report In/Output</h2>

<p>Reports have several ways of interacting with the user. As a basic and very easy to use method they can 
generate output by simply dumping text to a stream that is displayed in ReportView 
(see <a href=./Report.html#println()>println()</a>).</p>

<p>Alternatively the start method can return an instance of one of the following types which is then
presented to the user:
<table>
 <tr><td>Type</td><td>Result</td></tr>
 <tr><td>java.net.URL</td><td>Platform's browser is opened to show the URL</td></tr>
 <tr><td>genj.chart.Chart</td><td>Chart is shown in report view</td></tr>
 <tr><td>javax.swing.JComponent</td><td>Component is shown in report view</td></tr>
 <tr><td>genj.fo.Document</td><td>User is asked for document formatting and the result is shown</td></tr>
 <tr><td>java.io.File</td><td>Platform's default viewer for file is opened</td></tr>
 <tr><td>genj.view.ViewContext.ContextList</td><td>List of Gedcom objects is shown to user in report view</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Reports can also ask for input:
 <ul>
  <li>ask the user for a directory
    (see <a href="./Report.html#getDirectoryFromUser(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)">getDirectoryFromUser()</a>)
  <li>ask the user to select an entity (e.g. Individuals, 
    see <a href="./Report.html#getEntityFromUser(java.lang.String, genj.gedcom.Gedcom, java.lang.String)">getEntityFromUser()</a>)
  <li>ask the user to make a choice (e.g. yes/no, 
    see <a href="./Report.html#getOptionFromUser(java.lang.String, int)">getOptionFromUser()</a>)
  <li>ask the user to enter a value (e.g. name as text,
    see <a href="./Report.html#getValueFromUser(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object[], java.lang.Object)">getValueFromUser()</a>)
 </ul>
</p>

<p>
 All of these methods are defined in the super-class <a href=./Report.html>Report</a> that every
 custom Report needs to extend.
</p>

<h2>Compiling Reports</h2>

<p>
 Since Reports are written in Java they have to be compiled before they can be used through GenJ. This can be
 achieved by running the Recompile Reports reports from within the UI and then clicking on the reload button
 in the Run-dialog of Report View.
