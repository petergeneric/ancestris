<body>

Gedcom is a standardized format for genealogic data exchange and serves as
the foundation of GenealogyJ. To achieve a maximum level of compatibility
GenJ reads and writes Gedcom files natively (no ex/import) and its internal
representation of the data is very close to the original.

<p>The Gedcom API is documented here since it's the access point for 
<a href="../report/package-frame.html" target="packageFrame">reports</a> 
and 3rd party code that needs to access Gedcom-information and wants to 
utilize an existing object-oriented layer.</p>
