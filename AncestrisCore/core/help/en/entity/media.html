<P>
 Instances of type Multimedia Object can store binary data like
 images, scanned documents or recordings. A media object can
 be instantiated once and referenced by several other entities
 that have some kind of connection to the contained data.
</P>

<P>
 <font color=red><b>Important Note</b></font>: This type of entity, 
 storing the binary uuencoded information within the Gedcom structure,
 creates exorbitantly large .ged files and is therefore modelled in 
 GenJ for compatibility with the Gedcom standard only.  
 To associate images and other files with your Gedcom information it 
 is recommended to use the Multimedia Property (which can be added to 
 an existing property through its context-menu). This property contains
 a sub-property FILE that stores a filename instead of the file contents.
</P>
