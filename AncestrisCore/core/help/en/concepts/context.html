<h2>Working with Context Menus</h2>

<p>
 The most important thing to try while working with GenJ is triggering
 the context-menus. A right-click <font size=-2>(your platform might 
 have a different mouse action to trigger them)</font> on the information 
 displayed in one of the <a href="../views.html">views</a> will reveal 
 actions you can take.
</p>

<p>
 The context-menu is always structured the same way : at first place it 
 shows a sub-menu for what you have clicked on and then, in the next
 level of the menu, further options are offered that broaden the context. 
</p>

<p>
 In the following example the context for a Name-property is shown. 
 The first sub-menu is for the property itself and actions on it, the 
 second sub-menu is for the entitiy (here an Individual) this property 
 belongs to, the third sub-menu is for the file (Gedcom) the entity belongs to. 
  <blockquote><img src="../../images/screenshots/context1.png"></blockquote>
 The sub-menu for the Individual 'I008' shows the following actions:
 <ul>
  <li>Add Child - a child (and family if necessary) for I008
  <li>Add Spouse - a spouse (and family if necessary) for I008
  <li>Add Sibling - a sibling (and parents if necessary) for I008
  <li>Add Repository - a external repository with information concerning I008
  <li>Add Multimedia Object - an object storing binary data 
  <li>Add Note - a note describing I008
  <li>Add Submitter - the person who submitted the information about I008
  <li>Add Source - the source for information about I008
  <li>Add Association - an association with another Individual
  <li>Delete - to remove the entity I008
 </ul>
</p>

<p>
 The next example again shows a context-menu for a property but this time
 the actions for the property itself are shown (first sub-menu).
  <blockquote><img src="../../images/screenshots/context3.png"></blockquote>
 These are the actions offered:
 <ul>
  <li>Add Note - this note can keep data specific to that birth
  <li>Add Source - this source can capture where the information about the birth came from
  <li>Add Multimedia Object - this object can store binary data that concerns the birth
  <li>Delete - remove the information about the birth (property BIRT) completely
 </ul>
</p>


<p>
 Lastly an example which emphasizes the dynamic way the content of the context-menus
 is generated. The following logic was applied when constructing the menu for a
 right-click on a node in the Tree View:
 <ul>
  <li>the context being clicked on isn't a representation of a property but of an entity 
    (here Individual I008) so the first sub-menu is that for the Individual
  <li>the view the context-menu is displayed in - <a href="../view/tree.html">Tree View</a> -
    has added a special view-dependent action <em>Add Bookmark</em>
 </ul>
  <blockquote><img src="../../images/screenshots/context2.png"></blockquote>
 The actions shown in the sub-menu allow the creation of new
 <a href="../entities.html">Entities</a> in file example.ged. It's advisable
 though to "grow existing information" instead of creating standalone
 entities like Individuals or Families. To create related/referenced entities
 use the sub-menus for properties or entities as described above.
