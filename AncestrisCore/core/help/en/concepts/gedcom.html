<h2>Gedcom</h2>

<p>
Gedcom is a standard for exchanging genealogical information in an electronic 
format. This is important because GenJ's core is modelled around it.
That's not necessarily visible at the surface but knowing about Gedcom 
helps to understand why the things in GenJ work the way they do.
</p>

<p>
Generally all Gedcom information is hierarchically structured. An entity
(Individual, Family, Media, Note, Source, Submitter or Repository) is 
comprised of a tree of properties without an inherent limit on depth
or number of nodes. 
There's a large set of well-defined properties (like Date, Name, Sex, etc.) 
for each entity, each capturing values understood by all applications 
supporting the standard.
</p>

<p>
The Gedcom file is a simple text file with one line per property. There's
no notion of closing and ending Tags (like in XML) - lines have different
marked levels instead. The level is specified by a number - then follows a tag 
identifying the property.
Here is an example of a record for an individual (different levels are 
textually indented for readability only):

<p>
The power of GenealogyJ is that it allows this nested information to
be edited in its hierarchical form. All defined properties are treated in a
way that offers specific input for editing - no need to look at the text file.
Since GenJ knows about properties which reference entities, it handles the 
referential integrity and allows for easy construction of relationships
(like adding a child to a parent or adding a spouse to an individual).
GenJ knows about the Gedcom standard and will suggest sub-properties to add 
to properties if desired. 
</p>

<p>
The current Gedcom version supported by GenJ is
<a href="http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~pmcbride/gedcom/55gctoc.htm">5.5</a>.
If you feel like learning more about Gedcom please feel encouraged to
browse the specification - it's an ongoing effort to align GenJ as closely 
as possible with this standard.
