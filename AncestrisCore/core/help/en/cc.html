<h2>Control Center</h2>

<p>
The first window you see after starting GenJ shows a list of opened Gedcom files. 
On first usage one file 'example.ged' should have been loaded automatically. You 
can either explore GenJ's features by opening <a href="./views.html">views</a> on 
that file or you can create your own file to start with first. The buttons at 
the top of the window let you do just that:

<p>
You can open as many views as you want - they will be numbered sequentially
and each keep their own settings and preferences in case you want to look
at your data from "different angles".
