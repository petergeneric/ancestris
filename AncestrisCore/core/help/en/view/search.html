<p>
This view allows to search for properties by their contained values.
Simply enter a value into the field at the top. Then optionally
enter a selector into the second field (click on the button to
the left to pick from a prepared list, e.g. INDI:OCCU for occupation).
Finally click on the first button in the toolbar to start the search.

If you're experienced with Regular Expressions then enter those
in the search-value field (you can turn off matching with 
regular expressions through the checkbox above this field).
