<h2><a href="../views.html">Views</a> - Entity View</h2>

<p>
This view renders one entity and its properties into a single
pane. This can be setup as the most complex rendering option
that might not be feasible for the <a href="./tree.html">Tree View</a>
because of the resulting performance hit.
</p>

<p>
When selecting an entity in any of the other views this view
will change its selection and render it as you browse the
available entities.
</p>
