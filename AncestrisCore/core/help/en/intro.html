GenJ is a viewer and editor for genealogical data and is written in 
100% pure Java. It can easily be <a href="./special/translation.html">translated</a> to other languages. You're invited to use it for of charge, download the 
	source code or join the <A href="./team.html">team</A> and contribute.
</p>

<p>
This online help gives you a head start about GenJ's features
and tells a little bit about its inner workings and hidden specials :).
Having a powerful tool for working with genealogical information like GenJ
is great but some things are not quite easy to find for the novice user.
The sections about general <a href="./concepts.html">Concepts</a> are
a good starting point since they provide the conceptual background for 
working with the <a href="./views.html">Views</a>.
The <a href="./special/faq.html">FAQ</a> provides useful hints for the 
work with GenJ.
