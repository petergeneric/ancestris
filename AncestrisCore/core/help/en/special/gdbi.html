<h2>Running LifeLines reports</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lifelines/">LifeLines</a> reports are not directly supported by GenJ. You need an additional program called <a href="http://gdbi.sourceforge.net">GDBI</a> for that. GDBI is the abbreviation for Gedcom DataBase Interface and can be integrated with several genealogical programs to provide additional features. GenJ is one of those applications and can thus run LifeLines reports.
</p>

<h2>Installation, program start</h2>

<p>
The installation for the usage with GenJ is explained in the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/gdbi/doc/">GDBI documentation</a> (also accessible via the GDBI homepage). The necessary file is <tt>genj.html</tt>. Two notes:
<ol>
<li>You can also use an archive program with support for the jar-format for unpacking the report classes (<tt>ReportBK.class, ReportLL.class</tt>), e.g. WinRAR.</li>
<li>To start GenJ with GDBI you have to execute the batch file (*.bat) created during the installation process and <font color=red>not</font> the GenJ main script as usual.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Working with GDBI</h2>

After successful installation and correct program startup two new entries appear in the report view. The entries start with <tt>GDBI:</tt>
<p>

Only <tt>GDBI: LifeLines report</tt> is relevant to running LifeLines reports. After this report is started a file chooser dialog appears in which the desired LifeLines reports has to be choosen. After that GDBI processes the report instructions and presents the result.
