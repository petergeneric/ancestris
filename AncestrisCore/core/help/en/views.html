<h2>Working with Views</h2>

<p>
 Once you've opened a <a href="./concepts/gedcom.html">Gedcom</a> file (*.ged) 
 through <a href="cc.html">Control Center</a> you can open views on it.
</p>

<p>
 Views all work on the same underlying data - this means that
 <ul>
  <li>changes performed in one view immediately become effective in 
     other views on the same file
  <li>selection events from one view propagate to the other views 
     on the same file*
  <li>closing a file will close all views on that file
  <li><a href="./concepts/context.html">context-menus</a> for the displayed
     information offer actions in all views
 </ul>
 <p align=right><font size=-2>
    *changes in selection to one view might not be reflected in
     another if the latter cannot follow the selection
 </font></p>
</p>

<p>
 Typically you will open one instance per type of view - not necessarily
 all but combinations that help to navigate and understand the underlying
 data. For example
 <ul>
  <li>Tree&amp;Table View to browse the existing information
  <li>Table&amp;Edit View to cleanup, catalog and edit the existing information
  <li>Report View to run reports on large files
 </ul>
</p>

<p>
 The combination is not limited and you'll soon get a feeling for which 
 views fullfill your needs. The views will remember the 
 position and size of the enclosing windows so position them as required
 and they will pop-up at the same place next time. You can also open
 several instances of the same view to check out different angles -
 they're numbered sequentially.
</p>

<p>
 Here now is the list of views at your disposal:
