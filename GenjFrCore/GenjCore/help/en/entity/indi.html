<h2><a href="../entities.html">Entities</a> - Individual</h2>

<p>
 The information about individuals is the most important part
 of any genealogical set of data. In GenJ instances of type
 Individual act as the container for all information known about 
 a person like yourself, your father, your children and any other 
 descendant or ancestor, etc. 
</p>

<p>
 When modelling relationships between individuals a web
 of information evolves. This makes it possible to derive
 information about lineage and families' heritage. 
 Relationships based on kinship are not captured directly
 through references to e.g. spouse, children or parents. Instead
 an indirection through references to <a href="./fam.html">Families</a>
 is used. So having a spouse means to be spouse in a family
 with another spouse and having parents means to be child in
 a family with two spouses.
