GenealogyJ - README 1ST

Prerequisites

 GenealogyJ requires you to have a Java environment of version
 1.4 or higher. Please run 'java -version' in case you're unsure
 of what's installed on your machine.

Running GenJ Application (part of genj_app-x.y.zip)

 Execute one of the start-scripts in the main application folder:
 
  run.sh   Unix
  run.cmd  OS2/Windows 
  run.bat  Windows     

 If jar-files are associated with 'javaw' on your system a simple
 double-click on run.jar is sufficient (the association has to 
 be set up to call 'javaw -jar %1').

Running GenJ Applet (part of genj_applet-x.y.zip)

 See ./doc/applet.txt

Problems
   
 If you encounter runtime problems open genj.log (~/genj.log on
 unix or %USERPROFILE%\genj.log on windows) and send it as an 
 attachement to genj-developer@lists.sourceforge.net. Please also 
 include a description of the problem.
  
 For general discussions of features and usability send an
 email to genj-user@lists.sourceforge.net.
