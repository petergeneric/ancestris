<h2>Blueprints</h2>

<p>
 Looking at Gedcom information in a structured hierarchical manner like
 <a href="../view/edit.html">Edit View</a> or <a href="../view/table.html">Table View</a>
 is one thing. Rendering the information about an entity in a static 2d way 
 is another. Both <a href="../view/tree.html">Tree View</a> and
 <a href="../view/entity.html">Entity View</a> do just that. They render
 individuals and entities in a constrained rectangular space on your screen
 or paper.
</p>

<p>
 The underlying technology used for this by GenJ is HTML. The instructions
 of how to render an entity is called a Blueprint. It consists of standard
 HTML with the addition of a new HTML element "prop".
</p>

<p>
 Here's an example: 
 <pre>
      &lt;b&gt;<b>&lt;</b><font color=green>prop</font> <font color=blue>path=INDI</font><b>&gt;</b>&lt;/b&gt;
      <b>&lt;</b><font color=green>prop</font> <font color=blue>path=INDI:NAME</font><b>&gt;</b>
      born <b>&lt;</b><font color=green>prop</font> <font color=blue>path=INDI:BIRT:DATE</font><b>&gt;</b>
      in <b>&lt;</b><font color=green>prop</font> <font color=blue>path=INDI:BIRT:PLAC</font><b>&gt;</b>,
      lived in <b>&lt;</b><font color=green>prop</font> <font color=blue>path=INDI:RESI:ADDR:CITY</font><b>&gt;</b>
      and worked as a <b>&lt;</b><font color=green>prop</font> <font color=blue>path=INDI:OCCU</font><b>&gt;</b>. </pre>
 which looks like this once rendered:
 <blockquote>
   <b>I008</b> Meier, Nils born 25 May 1970 in Rendsburg, lived
   in San Francisco and worked as a Software Engineer.
 </blockquote>
<p>

<p>
 As you can see the "path" argument to "prop" contains a 
  <a href="../concepts/paths.html">Tag Path</a>
 identifying what to render into the text-flow. Here the following
 values of properties are resolved;
 
 <blockquote><table>
  <tr>
   <td><font color=blue>path=...</font></td><td>result</td><td>individual's ...</td>
  </tr><tr>
   <td>INDI                         </td><td>I008        </td><td>ID</td>
  </tr><tr>
   <td>INDI:NAME                    </td><td>Meier, Nils</td><td>name</td>
  </tr><tr>
   <td>INDI:BIRT:DATE               </td><td>25 May 1970</td><td>birth date</td>
  </tr><tr>
   <td>INDI:BIRT:PLACE              </td><td>Rendsburg  </td><td>birth place</td>
  </tr><tr>
   <td>INDI:RESI:ADDR:CITY          </td><td>San Francisco</td><td>city of residence</td>
  </tr><tr>
   <td>INDI:OCCU                    </td><td>Software Engineer</td><td>occupation</td>
  </tr>
 </table></blockquote>
 
 By using different blueprints the same data can be rendered in various ways, because
 different sets of information, layouts and colors can be choosen:
 
  <blockquote><img src="../../images/screenshots/blueprint1.png"></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
 Views utilizing blueprints will offer to select and edit them through their settings.
 Predefined blueprints cannot be changed but user-defined blueprints can be changed
 once created (blueprints are managed globally and not per view).
</p>

<p>
 <b><font color=red>Note</font></b>: This is a very advanced feature that won't be necessary
 to be understood by all users. The default blueprints should be sufficient for
 80% of the users.
