<h2><a href="../views.html">Views</a> - Tree View</h2>

<p>
 When looking at the information contained in a Gedcom
 file through this view family-relationships are key.
 To build a visual tree GenJ starts with the root
 of the tree (an individual or family) and collects
 all ancestors and descendants of that root. 
<p>

</p>
 The individuals and families are nodes in the tree, arcs
 are spouse-family and family-child relationships. Only
 direct line relationships are considered. So for a person
 to be visible in this view he/she has to be 
 <ul>
  <li>root itself
  <li>ancestor of root (direct line)
  <li>descendant of root (direct line)
  <li>spouse of root or spouse of root's descendants (if
    enabled)
 </ul>
 Here is an example (zoomed out):
  <blockquote><img src="../../images/screenshots/tree1.png"></blockquote>
 The tree can be browsed by using the scrollbars on the
 left and at the bottom (if necessary). By clicking on the
 un/fold handles (marked green) branches of the tree can
 be hidden or brought into view. 
</p>

<p>
 To change the root of the tree simply double-click on
 any of the visible nodes. Note: individuals previously
 visible might disappear if one of the rules above doesn't
 apply anymore, You can bookmark an individual or family
 through its context-menu (right-click) to be able to 
 return to a previous root.
</p>
