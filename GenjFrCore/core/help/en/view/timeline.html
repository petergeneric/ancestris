<h2><a href="../views.html">Views</a> - Timeline View</h2>

<p>
 This view shows events stored in a Gedcom file from left to right 
 on a timeline. It starts at the earliest point in time of an event 
 reaching to the latest event.
 The Gedcom specification defines specific properties for Individuals
 and Families that are considered to be events (identified through 
 Tags like BIRT, DEAT or GRAD).
  <blockquote><img src="../../images/screenshots/timeline1.png"></blockquote>
 The header contains year indicators distributed evenly from left to
 right. The events consist of a little marker, a symbol, text (optional) and
 the date when the event happened (optional).
</p>

<p>
 Events are broken into several lines when they might overlap otherwise.
 Use the scrollbars at the right and the bottom to browse the information.
