cc.about.tab4.text1              = GenJ and of course Ancestris, is what we name an "Open\
Source" software, it means source code is freely available, free of redistribution, \
whether the software itself, and our derivated work.\nAs we didn't want the main \
archive to be too heavy to download, we decided to gather all source code in a \
separate file. As we thought it could be interesting to have the code used for reports, \
we added it to the main archive though. It's an encouragement for you, to take a look \
at it, to modify it, and to make the genj communauty to benefit of your work.\n\nAs \
we said, the source code is available as "genj_arvernes_source.zip". You can grab it \
using this URL :\nhttp://www.arvernes.com/wiki/index.php/Genj_-_T\u00e9l\u00e9charger_Genj\n
