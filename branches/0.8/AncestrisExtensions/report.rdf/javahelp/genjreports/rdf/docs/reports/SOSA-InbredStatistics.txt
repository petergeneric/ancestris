# Effects of inbreed on the sosa numbers of the tree tops.
#
# _SOSA properties must have been generated before conversion.
#       In case of inbred multiple properies are expected
#       not multiple numers in a single property.
#       Use: View - lists and reports - tool box - choose tool to run: 
#                                           generation of sosa numbers
#       Not: Tools - gedcom - regenerate sosa numbers
#
# Puzzled about interpreting the numbers.
# For example:
#     diff = 8 = 2^3 : the 3rd generation married in the family
# But what happens when different generations marry?
# Must be more complex.
