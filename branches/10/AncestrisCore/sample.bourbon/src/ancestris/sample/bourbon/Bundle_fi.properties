OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=This plugin gives you a good idea of what a genealogy looks like with Ancestris. Three Kings of France are represented, Louis XIII, Louis XIV, and Louis XV.\n\nWe set default parameters to give you the opportunity to see something without doing anything. You will see how the gedcom specifications organize the data, that way it's a good tutorial to help you to build your own genealogy the same way.\n\nThose samples of genealogy are available thru the welcome page. In the "Learn and Discover tab", click on one of them as "House of Bourbon", "Kennedy genealogy", etc.
