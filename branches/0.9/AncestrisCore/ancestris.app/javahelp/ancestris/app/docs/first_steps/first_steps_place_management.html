    This is an important chapter. A close reading 
    will avoid having to, some day, repeat all your work. 
    Adopting a universal and uniform jurisdictions order, 
    compliant with the Gedcom standart, is indispensable for  
    ease your exchanges and make the geolocation of the 
    events more accurate.

  <h3 class="ancestris_help_title">Sorting the jurisdictions</h3>
  <p class="justify">
    To create a place, you should classify the different 
    jurisdictions in growing order of importance, separating  
    each level with a comma. If a level is empty,  
    keep the comma.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="marge40">
    <i><u>Advise from Ancestris</u>:&nbsp;unlike certain  
    practices, don't leave blank spaces between jurisdictions.</i><br>
  </p>
    Seven levels of jurisdiction are possible:<br>
    <center><i>Hamlet,City,,ZIP_Code,County,State,Country</i></center>
  <p class="justify">
    It's not mandatory to have them all but you should 
    <b>respect the hierarchy of this order</b>.

              <p class="justify">
                Although Ancestris allows to input the <b>ZIP 
                code</b>, it is preferable to use the
                <b>INSEE code</b>. As a matter of fact, a ZIP code can
                group more cities while the INSEE code
                (geographic codding system
                created in 1943), is unic for each city (only valid in France).

  <h3 class="ancestris_help_title">Inputing jurisdictions</h3>
  <p class="justify">
    If you chose ''Distinguish for editing the  
    jurisdictions for places'' (cf <a href="../first_steps/first_steps_basic_ancestris.html"> 
    First Settings</a>) you don't need the following explanations, since you will be 
    inputing jurisdictions level by level.<br>
    For those who didn't choose this option, the easiest way to 
    explain is an example:<br>
    For an event happened in the hamlet of 
    "Mézin", at Allanche (INSEE code 15160), 
    Cantal department, Auvergne, France. You should 
    input:
  </p>
  <center>
  <img src="../images/screenshots/screenshots_first_steps_place_management_saisie_lieux.png" alt="Jurisdictions input screen." width="480" height="50">
  </center>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Don't write anything after the word France.</i></li>
    <li><i>If hamlet is unknown, just put a comma at the begining  
    of the line.</i></li>
    <li><i>For an event to which only the city  
    is known, write: ,Allanche,,,,  (1 leading comma and 
    4 trailling commas).</i></li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  It's simple, to remember: ''From the smalest to the greates and each term is 
  comma separated''.

    the <u>already known places</u> starting with the same characters,

    click on <b>OK</b> to validate and that's it.<br>

  <h3 class="ancestris_help_title">Register jurisdctions order in the Gedcom file</h3>
  <p class="justify">
    It is important that this places hierarchy (or jurisdictions 
    order) is described in the header of your Gedcom  
    file. It's the internal rule, established by the Gedcom file  
    that allows Ancestris e the other  
    users to reed the jurisdictions. This record 
    determines the format of all your "PLAC" tags.<br>
    <u>This register should be made imediately whe creating  
    a genealogy or right after importing a  
    genealogy created with another programa</u> 
    (many do not respect the standart).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>1st solution:
      <ul>
        <li>Open Gedcom editor. Select a PLAC line   
        (anyone)<br>
        - left click (to highlight) and then right click 
        to open the context menu.<br>
        - click on  ''Set hierarchy  
        for place-values''<br>
        <img src="../images/screenshots/screenshots_first_steps_place_management_ordonnancement_des_juridictions.png" alt="Order of jurisdictions on the Gedcom file." width="480" height="240"><br>
        Use the input line to control, modify or 
        input the different jurisdictions you have 
        defined for all you genealogy.<br> 
        To validate your choice: click on "Proceed 
        and Set hierarchy for place-values locais".<br> 
        Done! You should consider backing up your work.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>2nd solution:
      <ul>
        <li>Open your Gedcom file with a text editor. 
        For Linux, use Gedit, or Nedit or Jedit. For Windows, 
        use Notepad (never Word). For MacOs, use TextEdit.<br>
