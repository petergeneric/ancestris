<h2><a href="../views.html">Views</a> - Navigator View</h2>

<p>
 GenJ offers several ways to navigate through your genealogical data. You can
 pick individuals and families in the <A href="./tree.html">Tree View</A>,
 select entities in the <A href="./table.html">Table View</A> or browse
 properties in the <A href="./edit.html">Edit View</A> and jump to other
 referenced entities. As a navigating tool the Navigator View allows
 you to follow relationships of individuals globally. 
 Other views opened on the same Gedcom file will change their selection
 appropriately to match this.
</p>

<p>
 The following picture shows what the Navigator View offers with its six
 buttons. At the top the name of the currently selected individual is
 displayed. The buttons below are arranged according to their functionality
 (from a hierarchical perspective).<br>
  <blockquote> <img src="../../images/screenshots/navigator.png"> </blockquote>
 <ol>
  <li>Up - Father
  <li>Up - Mother
  <li>Left - Older Sibling
  <li>Center - Spouse
  <li>Right - Younger Sibling
  <li>Down - (1st) child
 </ol>
 Every click on one of these buttons will navigate in the "according direction"
 (buttons like (e.g) Father will be disabled if no father for the current 
  individual is defined).
