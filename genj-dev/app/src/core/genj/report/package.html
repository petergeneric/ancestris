<body>

Reports are simple, plug-able Java Types which are executed in the context 
of GenealogyJ. They can access the underlying object-representation of 
Gedcom-files opened by the user. 

<p>
A selection of reports comes with the GenealogyJ distribution and can be
found in the report-directory inside the GenJ installation directory.
</p>

<h2>Running Reports</h2>

<p>There are multiple ways of intergrating a report with GenJ. Generally every 
report found in the report-directory (or one of its sub-directories) will be
loaded and displayed in ReportView. There the user can read about the
report's author and operation description, set report-options and run 
them individually. </p>

<p>A report can also be run by opening the context-menu for a Gedcom element
in the UI. Depending on the selected element (for example an entity, a
property or a Gedcom-file itself) reports that can accept this context as
input are presented. A report declares whether it can run on a given
context by overriding 
 <pre> <a href=./Report.html#accepts(java.lang.Object)>String accepts(Object context)</a> </pre>
and returning a textual description of the action the report will do if
executed (if applicable - null otherwise). 
</p>

<p>
By default it's assumed that a report can be executed on instances of the 
<a href=../gedcom/Gedcom.html>Gedcom</a> type - when run the report is 
called with a reference to the instance of the corresponding type.
</p>

<h2>Report In/Output</h2>

<p>
Reports have several ways of interacting with the user - they can generate output:
 <ul>
  <li>print text to a stream that is displayed in ReportView's report output widget
   (see <a href=./Report.html#println()>println()</a>)
  <li>open a browser on a URL
   (see <a href=./Report.html#showBrowserToUser(java.net.URL)>showBrowserToUser()</a>)
  <li>show a chart to the user
   (see <a href=./Report.html#showChartToUser(genj.chart.Chart)>showChartToUser()</a>)
  <li>show a Java Swing component to the user
   (see <a href=./Report.html#showComponentToUser(javax.swing.JComponent)>showComponentToUser()</a>)
  <li>show a list of predefined items containing references to Gedcom objects to the user
   (see <a href=./Report.html#showItemsToUser(java.lang.String,%20genj.gedcom.Gedcom,%20java.util.List)>showItemsToUser()</a>)
 </ul>
</p>

<p>
And they can ask for input:
 <ul>
  <li>ask the user for a directory
    (see <a href=./Report.html#getDirectoryFromUser(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)>getDirectoryFromUser()</a>)
  <li>ask the user to select an entity (e.g. Individuals, 
    see <a href=./Report.html##getEntityFromUser(java.lang.String,%20genj.gedcom.Gedcom,%20java.lang.String)>getEntityFromUser()</a>)
  <li>ask the user to make a choice (e.g. yes/no, 
    see <a href=./Report.html#getOptionFromUser(java.lang.String,%20int)>getOptionFromUser()</a>)
  <li>ask the user to enter a value (e.g. name as text,
    see <a href=./Report.html#getValueFromUser(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Object[],%20java.lang.Object)>getValueFromUser()</a>)
 </ul>
</p>

<p>
 All of these methods are defined in the super-class <a href=./Report.html>Report</a> that every
 custom Report needs to extend.
</p>

<h2>Compiling Reports</h2>

<p>
 Since Reports are written in Java they have to be (manually) compiled before they
 can be used through GenJ. Run one of the compile scripts in the directory containing
 all reports for that.
