     * This method is used to free the library at the end of progam execution. After this call, any

     * <b>DO NOT CALL THIS METHOD DIRECTLY!</b><br>
     * It is used by the librarian to free a native library before physically deleting it from its
     * temporary loaction. A call to this method is likely to irrecoverably freeze the application!
     * <br>
     * <br>
     * The contract for this method implementation is that a call will bring the native library into
     * a state where it can be deleted. This translates into an operation to free the library. Since
     * no libraries should be left behind when the installer shuts down, it is necessary that each
     * library provides the means to free itself. For instance in a MS-Windows environment the
     * library must call <code>FreeLibraryAndExitThread()</code>. This will result in a native
     * fuction call that does not return.
     *
     * @param name the name of the library, without path but with extension
