<h1>IzPack overview</h1>

<h2>What it can do for you</h2>

<p>IzPack is a powerful software installers generator for the Java[tm]
    platform. It uses a very modular architecture that lets you make the
    installers work as you want, not as the software wants it to work. It is also
    possible to extend it to suit your needs since it has been designed with this
    purpose in mind from the start.<br></p>

<h2>Package once, install anywhere</h2>

<p>The installers generated by IzPack are independent of the target operating
    system. It has been running successfully on Linux/i386, FreeBSD, Solaris,
    MacOS X and Win32. All it needs is a Java[tm] Runtime Environment.<br></p>

<h2>Cool licensing</h2>

<p>IzPack is published under the terms of Apache License Version 2.0.<br></p>
