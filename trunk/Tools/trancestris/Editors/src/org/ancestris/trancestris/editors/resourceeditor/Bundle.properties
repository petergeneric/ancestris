ResourceEditorTopComponent.jLabel1.toolTipText=<html>This is the translation window. It's in it that you have to write your translation.<br />An important thing to know: your translation won't be saved if you don't click <br />on the OK button below.<br /><br />It's really important to respect the wording of the original sentences. So if the <br />original sentence has html codes, or variables, you <b>have to write them <br />exactly the same way</b> in your translated sentences.<br /><br /><u>An example</u>:<ul>if you have as a source sentence: "<i>Select {0} to create the windowing <br />model</i>" and you want to translate it into french, you will have to write: <br />"<i>Choisir {0} pour mod\u00e8le d'agencement du fen\u00eatrage</i>"</ul></html>
ResourceEditorTopComponent.jLabel2.toolTipText=<html>In that window you can see all the sentences, words you have to translate. They are <br />in the language you have choosen as a source, so if you translate from english to <br />german all the sentences displayed here are in english.<br /><ul><li>The black ones are already translated, but you should check them, maybe <br />something has been changed in the resources source file and not reported <br />in the language you translate into.</li><li>The blue ones are already translated, but the sentences, words used in the<br />source language are the same as the ones available in the resulting language. <br />It's a good idea to check them though.</li><li>The red ones have to be translated.</li></ul>Click on one sentence, and begin your translation in the window below.</html>
ResourceEditorTopComponent.jLabel3.toolTipText=<html>This window shows you the comments that can be written in the ressources file<br />you are translating.<br />You don't have to do anything with them, it's just to give you all information <br />available in that bundle.</html>
