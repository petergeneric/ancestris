OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    <h1><center>Genealogy - Kennedy</center>\n\n<p>This plugin gives you an idea of what a genealogy looks like with\
    Ancestris. Of course, it's very limited, as our purpose is not to \
    establish the genealogy of that family, but we have had in mind to \
    show you how the GEDCOM tags are organized and to make it in \
    english only.\
    </p>\n\n<p>Please help us improve this genealogy.\
    </p>\n\n<p>This genealogy sample is available through the welcome page, "Learn and Discover tab".\
