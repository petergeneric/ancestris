OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    <h1><center>Genealogy - Kennedy</center></h1>\n\n<p>This example gives you an idea of what a genealogy looks like with\
    Ancestris. The extent of this genealogy is very limited, as our purpose is not to \
    establish the genealogy of that family, but show you how the data is organized.\
    </p>\n\n<p>Please do not hesitate to help us improve this genealogy.\
    </p>\n\n<p>This genealogy sample is available through the Welcome page, "Getting started" and "Genealogy Examples".\
