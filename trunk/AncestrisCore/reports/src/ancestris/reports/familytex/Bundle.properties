name    = List of families in TeX format

info    = <h1><center>List of Families (Tex format)</center></h1> \n\
 <h2><center>(TeX Output)</center></h3> \n\
  <p>This 'Families' report provides output in TeX format. This can be converted to PDF with a pdflatex converter for example LaTeX. \n\
  Save the report output in a *.tex file and start the conversion with <i>pdflatex filename</i></p> \n\
  <p>Use the report options to choose which data will appear in the report.</p> \n\
  <p>Note: This report is experimental and may have some errors.</p> \n\
  <p>Hint: If you turn off the option 'Include header and footer for Texfile' you can produce just the content and save this in it's own file. \n\
  Put the header and footer in a second file and write the TeX command \input (file_name_content) - use curly brackets instead of round parenthesis to include the content. \n\
  So the style and headers are separate from the content and will not be overwritten.</p> \n\
  Hint: If you put files with the names "head.tex" and "foot.tex" in the same directory as you store the output, they will be included.</p>
