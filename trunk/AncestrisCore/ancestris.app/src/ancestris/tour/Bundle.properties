           the right hand side is generally used to enter data into your genealogy.<br><br>\
           2. But you can adapt the positions of the windows according to your working needs:<br>\
           - Windows can be moved around if you drag-and-drop their tab handle.<br>\
           - They can also be put away as drawers on the screen borders.<br>\
