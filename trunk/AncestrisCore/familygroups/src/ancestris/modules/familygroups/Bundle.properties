OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    <h1><center>Family groups</center></h1>\n\n<p>This plugin gives you a list of the different family groups that make up your genealogy. \
    You can see groups of people who are not yet related together. The advantage of managing the family groups is that during your work, you will see \
    links between groups, and that way, connect one group to another group and thus have a continuity in the numbering of individuals and families in your family tree. \
    </p>\n\n<p>To access it, Main Menu, Tools, Quick reports, Family groups.\
