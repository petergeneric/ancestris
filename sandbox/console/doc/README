This is the GenJ-Console, a text-based user interface for the 
GenJ GEDCOM editor.

NOTE: GenJ-Console requires a J2SE v5.0 or greater JVM to run.

GenJ:Textmode exposes a console view on the GenJ Gedcom API.  
The intent is to allow for purely keyboard-driven genealogical data entry with
an emphasis on speed.

Right now, this textual user interface is to be used as a compliment to the main
GenJ GUI.   In order to streamline data entry, it has a bare-bones simple model
for how Individuals relate to Families, and cannot explore the full range of
expression that the (impliedd) GEDCOM datamodel allows.

The idea is to:
1) Do the bulk of the data entry in Textmode
2) save the  GEDCOM file and quit, then 
3) Re-open the file in GenJ proper, and do whatever cleanups/enhancement 
   are necessary
