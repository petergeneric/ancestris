<table><tr><td valign=top>

 <p>
  This view allows the user to edit the values associated with an entity (or record)
  within GenJ. This could be a place or a date pertaining to a person. It
  also could be the name of an external file. All the displayed fields can
  receive data and all changes have to be committed by clicking on 'OK'
  at the bottom. To cancel and revert back to the current state click on 'Cancel'.
 </p>

</td><td valign=top>

<table><tr><td valign=top>

 <p>
  There's an underlying structure to every entity in
  <a href="../concepts/gedcom.html">Gedcom</a> that can be made visible
  by clicking on the mode-button.
  This might be necessary at times to investigate the hierarchy of 
  (extended) properties and their values. In this mode any selection
  of a node in the hierarchy at the top is followed with an editor 
  at the bottom for that specific Gedcom property. Every displayed
  node at the top will also show a <a href="../concepts/context.html">Context Menu</a>
  if clicked with the right mouse-button.
