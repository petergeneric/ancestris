          Configuration of Trancestris is very simple.<br>
          <br>
          The first time you started Trancestris, most of what you had to configure 
          have been done, as you have been asked to configure how your computer 
          can send your translation once done. If you need to change something to 
          those settings, check the "<a href="./trancestris-configuration-mail.html">Send Translation</a>" (Mail) parameters.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
          Another setting is the language you want Trancestris to use when you 
          run it. Attention, it's not the language you want to translate to, it's 
          just the language Trancestris has to speak when you use it.
      </p>
      <p>
          The last parameters are gathered on the first tab of the settings 
          Menu. Do you use a proxy for your connection to the Internet? Set them 
          up accordingly.
