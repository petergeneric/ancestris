      Trancestris gives you the opportunity to search for a word in 
      the source language, but also in the destination language 
      (the language you want to translate to).<br>
      <br>
      The search function is a two parts search.<br>
      When you search for a word, it searches first in which 
      resources files the word is present. Once the list of all 
      the bundles files which match the search, is given and 
      displayed, you will have the possibility to search into 
      each properties resources file, you want.<br>
      Two things to remember: When you're looking for a word, 
      you have to take care to the way you spell it, and second: 
      the search can be "case sensitive" too. Looking for 
      "genealogy", is not the same than looking for 
      "Genealogy", if you have activated the 
      case sensitive option.<br>
      <br>
      <u>The best way to understand how it works, is to give an 
      example.</u><br>
      Let say you are translating from english to swedish.<br>
      <br>
      First search: you're looking for the word "Thanks".<br>
      So let's go. Click on the icon which represents a 
      magnifying glass.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="./images/Trancestris-first_steps2_1.png" width="400" height="98"/><br>
      <br>
      A window pops up. Do you want to 
      do a "<i>case sensitive</i>" 
      search? If so, don't forget to check the box "<i>Case 
      sensitive</i>", on the left of the window which pops up.<br>
      Write the word "Thanks", in the appropriate field. Once 
      done, click on "<i>Search</i>".<br>
      Result: a message says : "<i>No occurrence of "Thanks" found.</i>" 
      Strange, isn't it? No, there is no word "Thanks" in the 
      english resources files, that's all.<br>
      Now, uncheck the option "<i>Case sensitive</i>". The word 
      "Thanks" is always where you typed it. Click on 
      "<i>Search</i>". Bingo, there 
      is a resource file where the word "thanks" is present. 
      Which one? the window gives you the information, we find 
      the word "thanks", in the "<i>AncestrisCore/ancestris.app/src/ancestris/app</i>" 
      resources file.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="./images/Trancestris-first_steps2_2.png" width="400" height="340"/><br>
      <br>
      What to do next? Just double click on the line where the word 
      seems to be present, so on 
      "<i>AncestrisCore/ancestris.app/src/ancestris/app</i>".<br>
      Once done, you will see on the main window of Trancestris, 
      that it highlights the right resources file.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="./images/Trancestris-first_steps2_3.png" width="400" height="185"/><br>
      <br>
      On that main 
      window, you just have to click on the button "Next" on the 
      right of the menubar. Trancestris will focus on the 
      sentence where the word you're looking for, is present. It's 
      magic ;-)<br>
      <br>
      <img src="./images/Trancestris-first_steps2_5.png" width="400" height="108"/><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Second search: We want to search for the word "Geografisk" but in 
      swedish.<br>
      Click on the magnifying glass on the top main menu. A window pops 
      up. Type the word "Geografisk" in the blank field, check the 
      option "<i>Case sensitive</i>" search, on the left, and click 
      on the "<i>Swedish button</i>". Once done, click on 
      "<i>Search</i>". The screen will look like this one :<br>
      <br>
      <img src="./images/Trancestris-first_steps2_4.png" width="400" height="340"/><br>
      <br>
      On this screen you can see that the word you're looking for, 
      the word "Geografisk" is present in two resources files.<br>
      Double click on the first line, which is the first occurrence 
      found, the one which is named "<i>AncestrisCore/core/src/genj/gedcom</i>".
      Then do as it is explained above.<br>
      You want to see the second file for the word you're looking for? 
      Easy, double click on the line "<i>AncestrisExtensions/Geo/src/ancestris/modules/geo</i>".<br>
