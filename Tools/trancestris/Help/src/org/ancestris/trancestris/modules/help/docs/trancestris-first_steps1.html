        <h2><b><u>First Steps - I begin with Trancestris</u></b></h2>
      </center>
      <p>
          
          These are the different steps when for the first time you install and start Trancestris.
          
          <ul>
              <li>If you read this help file, it means you already downloaded and 
                  installed Trancestris. Don't forget to check on the web site for the 
                  latest file available. Even if Trancestris has an automatically 
                  update process, it's good from time to time to download and 
                  install the latest version offered.                  
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>Once downloaded, you have to start Trancestris.<br>
                  The first screen which appears is the following:<br>
                  <img src="Trancestris_start_step1.png" width="450" height="130"/>                  
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                  Don't change the first line, it's the repository of the bundles 
                  file. The second one is where you want the downloaded file 
                  "Ancestris_Bundles.zip" has to be saved on your computer. 
                  Default is your home directory. Change it for whatever you 
                  want but don't change the name of the file "Ancestris_Bundles.zip", 
                  change just the path if you want. The last line is certainly, 
                  one of the most important ones. You want to translate from 
                  which language, to which language. Here, I have Translate 
                  from English To English. Of course, I don't want to do so, 
                  so, I'm gonna change the second parameter and will choose 
                  for example Norwegian. I'm gonna have: "Translate from English 
                  To Norwegian". Click on "OK".
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                  A new window pops up, it's the "Tip of the Day". Read it and 
                  click on "close".<br>
                  <img src="Trancestris_start_step4a.png" width="350" height="221"/>
                  <br>
                  But in the background, Trancestris has downloaded the 
                  Ancestris_Bundles.zip file. Once downloaded a window appears 
                  that will give you the result of the process, it should be 
                  "The file has been downloaded". Click on "OK".<br>
                  <img src="Trancestris_start_step4.png" width="250" height="144"/>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                  New step, very important: you have to configure the settings 
                  to send your translation. So a message pops up which says: 
                  "Information - You must configure the extension before sending 
                  the translated bundle to the Ancestris Team. Go to Tools - 
                  Options -> Send Translation Tab". Click on "OK".<br>
                  <img src="Trancestris_start_step2.png" width="450" height="104" /><br>
                  This will open the appropriate config menu window you will 
                  have to <a href="trancestris-configuration-mail.html">configure</a>.<br>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                  Click on "OK" to save your changes.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                  Great, we are ready to begin to translate :-)
              </li>
              
          </ul>
      </p>
