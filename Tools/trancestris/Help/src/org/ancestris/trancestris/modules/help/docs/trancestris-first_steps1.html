      If you look at Trancestris main screen, you see on your left, 
      the "Resources File Explorer".<br>
      There, you have a tree view, which is collapsed, or 
      partly collapsed. You can see that there are some names, in 
      blue, and some in red. When a name is in blue it means that 
      all the sentences and words that belong to that branch of the 
      tree view, have been translated already. When you see the 
      color red, it means that we have to translate something in it.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      On the screenshot above, we don't have anything to translate in 
      the project "Tools", but we have to work (to translate), in the 
      AncestrisCore and AncestrisExtensions projects. Tools is in blue 
      and the first two ones are in red.<br>
      We have to expand the first project: AncestrisCore. Click on the 
      little triangle on the left (see the green arrow).<br>
      You should see the following screen.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="./images/Trancestris-first_steps1-2.png" width="400" height="210"/><br>
      <br>
      We can see here, that the subdirectory "core", needs a 
      translation, but not "api.editor", etc...<br>
      Click again on the little arrow, on the left of the word "core".<br>
      <br>
      <img src="./images/Trancestris-first_steps1-3.png" width="400" height="210"/><br>
      <br>
      Repeat that process until you can see the image below.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="./images/Trancestris-first_steps1-6.png" width="400" height="300"/><br>
      <br>
      Once there, we can see that "gedcom" is in blue, and it has 
      been fully translated (the color blue, but also the 100% 
      information). "actions", which is a subdirectory of "core", is 
      in red and needs a translation (we can see that nothing has 
      been translated, as we have a 0% already translated information). 
      "core", is in red, because its subdirectory "actions" needs 
      a translation. The sentences inside "core", have been fully 
      translated as we have a 100% already translated information.<br>
      What to do next? Click on the line "action (0%)" (see the green 
      arrow).<br>
      <br>
      Once done, you should see the following screen.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="./images/Trancestris-first_steps1-7.png" width="400" height="242"/><br>
      <br>
      Now we are ready to begin our translation.<br>
