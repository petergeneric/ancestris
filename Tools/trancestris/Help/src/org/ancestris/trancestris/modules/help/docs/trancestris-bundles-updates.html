      <h3 class="ancestris_help_title">What is a bundles package?</b>&nbsp;:</h3>
      <p class="justify">
        A bundles package (or bundles file) is a zip file which 
        contains all the sentences you have to translate 
        using Trancestris.<br>
        Its name is "<b><font color="#DF0101">Ancestris_Bundles.zip</font></b>".<br>
        <br>
        A Bundle is a language file. Each language has its appropriated 
        bundle files. For example, a greek bundle file is named 
        "<font color="#A4A4A4">Bundle_el.properties</font>", a swedish 
        bundle is named "<font color="#A4A4A4">Bundle_sv.properties</font>", 
        a french one "<font color="#A4A4A4">Bundle_fr.properties</font>", 
        etc. The main one is the english one, named 
        "<font color="#A4A4A4">Bundle.properties</font>" 
        (it's Bundle.properties and not Bundle_en.properties).<br>
        <br>
        Of course, you don't have to take care of that, Trancestris 
        will do it for you.<br>
        <br>
        How a bundle file looks like?<br>
        You don't have to edit it using an external editor. You can of 
        course, but no need to do so. Trancestris is there for you. Just 
        for your information, this is a screen capture of part of the 
        english bundle file (Bundle.properties) we can find in the 
        <font color="#A4A4A4">AncestrisCore/ancestris.app/src/ancestris/app</font>
        directory.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="./images/Trancestris-bundles-updates-3.png" width="450" height="238"/><br>
        <br>
        Each subdirectory of the source repository has bundles files 
        for each language.<br>
        For example the 
        <font color="#A4A4A4">AncestrisCore/core/src/ancestris/core</font>
        directory has the Bundle.properties, Bundle_fr.properties, 
        Bundle_sv.properties, Bundle_fi.properties, etc... files.<br>
        the <font color="#A4A4A4">AncestrisCore/core/src/ancestris/core/actions</font> 
        directory has also Bundle.properties, Bundle_fr.properties, 
        Bundle_sv.properties, Bundle_fi.properties, etc... files.<br>
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="ancestris_help_title">How do I know a new bundles package is available?</b>&nbsp;:</h3>
      <p class="justify">
        When Trancestris starts, it will query the Ancestris/Trancestris 
        repository where the bundles package is stored. If a new one is 
        available you will be warned that a new bundle package is 
        available and you will be asked whether or not you want to 
        download it.<br>

        The <b>following explanations are important</b>, please read them 
        carefully ;-)<br>
        <ul>
        <li><u><font color="#DF0101">You have not begun a translation</font></u>: 
        Please download that new bundles package. You will be sure 
        that way that the latest translations made by people will 
        be included in the package for your work.</li>
        <li><u><font color="#DF0101">You have begun a translation</font></u>: 
        The situation is the 
        following one : you translated something, you didn't send your 
        work, and have stopped Trancestris ; later, you restart 
        Trancestris, and have the message saying a new bundles package 
        is available. What to do? <font color="#DF0101">Don't 
        download it</font>. Say "No", and <font color="#DF0101">don't 
        translate any more sentences</font>. Send your work, and 
        wait for a message, a mail, from the Ancestris/Trancestris 
        manager in charge of the translation process. If you don't 
        have a mail within the next 24 hours, download the bundles 
        package offered by Trancestris, and go on with the translation. 
        The manager may be not available.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3 class="ancestris_help_title">Tips</b>&nbsp;:</h3>
      <p class="justify">
      Here are some tips it's good to know.<br>
        <ul>
        <li>Don't wait for too long to send your work.</li>
        <li>Once you send your work, wait for a message from the 
        Ancestris/Trancestris manager. See above.</li>
        <li>It's easier for us to add your work to Ancestris, if you 
        translate a whole bundle. No need to translate many many 
        bundles because it would be a hard work, but try to translate 
        fully the bundles you began.</li>
        </ul>
